  <p class="text-left -my-4 mx-60">One City is a project to connect the GLIDE and Kitchen communities. In partnership with the GLIDE Walk-In-Center, we are supporting GLIDE clients furnish their homes. <br>

The walk-in center works with hundreds of bright, righteous people each week who are wrestling with poverty, addiction and/or mental health challenges. Many of these people are trying to meet their basic needs—shelter, furniture, clothing.

Our monthly Team Captains & GLIDE staff have created a database of needed items. If you have any of the items and are ready to donate, email us here and monthly team captain will reach out with next steps.</p>
